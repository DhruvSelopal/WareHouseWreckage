My first unreal project!
My first unreal project!
I started learning python a year ago and then learned game some devlopment concepts with help of pygame.
But then i realized that if i have to learn game devlopment then python is not the answer.
Thus eventually i started learning c ( because of college exams) then c++.
Started to participate in contests on codechef and praticed on hackerrank.
After getting a good grip on c++ now i am moving towards unreal as unreal uses c++ besides blueprint.
This project is solely based on blueprint as i had to lean the functionalities and working of unreal.
The project is self explanatory , download the content and you'll see all the funtions are easy to understand.
I watched tutorial to get a grip on functions and meshes but i do have a personal touch in it.
Upcoming projects will also use c++ if not alone. 
Thank you
